If you want craet value. You must use the following construction.
Type nameValue
This language has the following type.
int
bool
float
Double
string
list
ref
Or you also can use construction
Type nameVariable
to chage type variable if the name variable exist in this area visible the type change otherwise the variable will be created.
If you want to creat list variable you need to use the following construction.
list variableName = {expression, expression, ...}
also you can creat multidimensional list so
list variableName = 
{
{expression, expression, ...},
{expression, expression, ...},
...
}
If you creat variable which has type ref.
You must when you creat the variable assign nameVariablee then all what you do with the variable.
All it will be reflected original variable.
for example 
ref refVariable = originalVariable
You must know that arithmetic expressions work os if you plus int + float you get int.
So you get value the same type that the first value.
The language has the following seies
While(expression)
{
body
},
for type valueName = expression; terms; iteration
{
body
},
do
{
  body
}while(expression)
